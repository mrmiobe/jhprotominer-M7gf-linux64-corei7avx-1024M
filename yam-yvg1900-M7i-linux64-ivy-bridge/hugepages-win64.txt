Q: What all these hugepages about?

A: This is all about efficient memory access, which is very important for mining performance.

Here is a nice explanation:

Q: Are hugepages somehow different from Windows Large-Page Support?

A: No, this is exactly same thing.

Q: I am getting the following error:

Error: Can not enable [SeLockMemoryPrivilege] privilege, error=1300
Warning: Huge Pages not available, performance may degrade

How can I fix that?

A: From StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39059/how-do-i-run-my-app-with-large-pages-in-windows

You will have to assign the "Lock pages in memory" privilege to any user that runs your application. This includes administrators

Select Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Local Security Policy
Select Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment
Double click "Lock pages in memory", add users and/or groups
Reboot the machine

On Windows Vista you need also make sure that the application is run as Administrator (by right-clicking on the application or the shell and choosing "Run as adminstrator").

In addition, it helps to have a freshly booted machine since the large pages can "run out" due to fragmentation of the heap.

Alternatively, you can reach Local Security Policy by "start secpol.msc"

Q: I did all the above, and still getting the error=1300. What shall I do?

A: Sometimes it is needed to add "Lock pages in memory" privilege to Administrators group, your user, and run cmd.exe as Administrator. Sometimes switching off UAC helps.

Q: I am getting the following error:

Error: Can not allocate hugepages memory, error=1450

How can I fix that?

A: From MSDN

ERROR_NO_SYSTEM_RESOURCES 
1450 (0x5AA)
Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service.

Ensure you have enough RAM. 8Gb of physical RAM is very strict minimum required to activate hugepages memory.
Reboot and try again. Sometimes memory fragmentation prevents from allocating enough hugepages memory.
Select smaller memory size, select less threads. If you are under virtualized environemnt, ensure both host and VM support hugepages.
Try with one thread and 512M RAM per thread.
