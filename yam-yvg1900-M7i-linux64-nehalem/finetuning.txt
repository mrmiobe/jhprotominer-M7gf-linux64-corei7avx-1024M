Fine tuning yvg1900 PTS miner

Most of performance optimizations are about tradeoffs… Imagine you have very fast CPU and very fast 
memory reads, while memory writes give you big performance penalty. Then you would like to avoid 
extra memory writes at cost of extra CPU loads by performing some extra comparisons in your code – 
this may lead to better performance, but may not as well, this is all about tradeoffs.

Some tradeoffs can be inferred from detectable hardware configuration – CPU model, available 
instruction set, etc., but most are heavily dependent on particular system specifics – memory speed, OS 
kernel configuration, virtualization, and many other parameters. Even more, some tradeoffs depend 
completely on personal preference – do you plan to dedicate machine completely for mining tasks of 
you plan to use it for something else, like browsing the Internet or listening music in background.

Manually finding out the best setup is non-trivial task; it requires perfect discipline and care. So, I 
decided to introduce built-in selection of algorithm variation that produces the best result in particular 
case and specific usage scenario.

1. Selecting miner version, memory size and thread count.

Before you can use fine tuning feature, you must decide which version of miner you would like to use, 
how much RAM you would like to allocate for miner use, and how many threads you would like it to run. 
Picking these parameters is more matter of your personal preference, and there is a lot of information 
on pros and cons of each setup. 

There are some contradictory opinions on results on selection of instruction set related variations of 
miner, but generally higher instruction set family leads to better mining performance. If you are in doubt 
– feel free to make tests and compare results yourself.

2. Activating fine tuning functionality

Fine tuning is disabled by default.

To enable fine tuning you shall add "av=0" parameter to PTS mining params when launching miner, for
example, if you use config file:

mining-params = pts:av=0&m=512

When fine tuning is enabled, miner will perform tests for each available algorithm variation and 
calculate appropriate scores.

As soon as fine tuning measurement stage progresses, you will see the best score displayed at every 
statistics display step. As soon as measurement stage finishes, miner will automatically select one with 
best score and proceed with selected algorithm variation until terminated. You can see currently 
selected variation as a value of "av" parameter.

Note that fine tuning stage may take long time to complete. 

3. Enforcing miner to use specific algorithm variation

As you may guess, miner operation is suboptimal during fine tune measurement stage. If you already 
know your optimal algorithm variation, you may wish to bypass fine tuning measurement stage and 
force miner to use specific algorithm variation. To do this simply specify desired algorithm variation as a 
value of "av" parameter when launching miner.

Good luck mining,
yvg1900
